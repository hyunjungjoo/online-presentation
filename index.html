# 1. Introduction
### How do we define intonational contour?

- When we speak, we produce strings of segments, but importantly always with some kind of melody, which is continuous and has ups and downs. This refers to **intonational contour**. 

- However, due to its continuous nature along the time course of speech sounds and its fluctuating nature along the pitch level, it is **difficult to find discrete phonological units of the intonational contour**.

&lt;img src="images/picture1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# 1. Introduction
### Autosegmental-Metrical (AM) theory of Intonational Phonology
- Intonational contours consist of **f0 turning points (e.g., Highs, Lows)**. 

- f0 curve is **just an output** from the linear interpolation between the targets.

&lt;img src="images/picture2.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
### This Autosegmental-Metrical model has been a mainstream theory in the Intonational Phonology for several decades. 
---
# 1. Introduction
### But there are some problems in the AM model.

.pull-left[
(1) Regions that could define crucial turning points are **frequently missing** from the f0 curve due to voicelessness or irregular phonation.

&lt;img src="images/picture16.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
(2) The f0 turning points cannot consider variations in f0 contour shapes. **Importantly, contour shapes matter in perceiving the rise-fall accent.**

# 1. Introduction
### An alternative to AM model has been proposed to account for variations in f0 contour.

- **A perceptual reference of the overall distribution** of the ‘weight’ or ‘mass’ of the f0 event.

- **A generalization about various aspects** of durations, slopes, curvatures, and symmetries of the rises and falls comprising f0 peaks.

# 2. Research questions
### Q1. Which theory better explains in categorizing L+H\* vs. L\*+H in American English?
- **Tonal Center of Gravity**  *vs.*  **AM model** (L, H turning points)

### Q2. How do two approaches work under adverse conditions?
- Even **when there are missing f0 values (noises)**, which theory better explains the intonational contour?

# Exp 1. Categorizing contrasting pitch accents: L+H\* vs. L\*+H
---
# 3. Methods

### 3.1. Participants
- Six native speakers of American English (18-50 years old)

### 3.2. Speech materials 
- 29 dialogues containing utterances like *There's a mellower one* with either **L+H\*** meaning *incredulity* or **L\*+H** meaning *uncertainty*. 

- A total of 116 productions per subject in a randomized block (29 dialogues x 4 repetition)

&lt;img src="images/picture4.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# 3. Methods

### 3.3. Labelling important timepoints of the f0 contour 
- To test the AM model, f0 minimum was analyzed as **an L turning point**, f0 maximum as **a H turning point**.

- To test the TCoG model, continuous f0 values of the shaded region were extracted and were computed with the TCoG equation, getting **a single time value** for each utterance.

# 4. Results
### 4.1 Binary logistic regression for the TCoG model
- Dependent variable: **pitch accent category** (**L+H\*** coded as **0**, **L\*+H** coded as **1**)

- Independent variable: **TCoG alignment** (mean distance from TCoG to midpoint of the accented vowel)

# 4. Results
### 4.1. Binary logistic regression for the TCoG model
- **Their description of Table 1**: "The substantial separation between TCoG alignments for the two pitch accents achieved for each speaker, suggesting that TCoG alignment could function as a reliable cue to pitch accent category."

- **Their description of Table 2 and 3**: "The results of this analysis make it clear that TCoG achieves significant success in classifying the productions of our participants by pitch accent category." 
    
    "This can be seen, in particular, in the high model chi-square obtained in the Likelihood Ratio test, the high value of Nagelkerke’s R-squared, and perhaps most transparently in the high overall percent correct shown in the classification table (nearly 95%)."
---
# 4. Results
### 4.1. Binary logistic regression for the TCoG model

- **Their description of Table 2 and 3**:

    **&amp;rarr; They didn't show specific interpretation of the logistic regression analysis in Table 2. For instance, this kind of interpretation needs to be added: one unit increase in TCoG alignment yields a change in the log odds of selecting "L\*+H" by 136. But in this case, this beta value seems weird since the probability of the log odds for 136 is 1 (100%). But the probability log odds over 17 are always 1 (100%).**
.pull-left[

```r
plogis(136)
```

```
## [1] 1
```
]
.pull-right[

```r
plogis(17)
```

```
## [1] 1
```
]

    **But when we look at the R-squared value, the regression model explains the variance well and the overall correct percentage is high, showing that the accuracy of their model is 94.3%.**

# 4. Results
### 4.2. Binary logistic regression for the AM model
- Dependent variable: **pitch accent category** (**L+H\*** coded as **0**, **L\*+H** coded as **1**)

- Independent variable: **Rise onset alignment** (mean distance from L turning point to onset of the accented vowel), **Peak alignment** (mean distance from H turning point to offset of accented vowel)

]
---
# 4. Results
### 4.2. Binary logistic regression for the AM model
- **Their description of Table 4 and 5**: "While the separation
between the means in each case is comparable in size to that between the mean
alignments for TCoG reported above, the standard deviations are higher for the
turning points.

    "This is particularly so for the rise onset, likely a reflection of the well-known ambiguity of the signal when it comes to identifying Low tones with single, precisely localizable F0 turning points."
---
# 4. Results
### 4.2. Binary logistic regression for the AM model
- **Their description of Table 6 and 7**: "The logistic regression analysis for each of the turning points in the AM model did not reach the level of the TCoG's categorization performance."

    "However, when the two turning points are used together as independent variables in a single model, the significance of the model improved, but not as good as the TCoG model. Compare the two, for example, with respect to model chi-square (522 vs. 606, p &lt; .001 in both cases), Nagelkerke’s R2 (.809 vs. .883), and correct classification percentage (90.9% vs. 94.3%)."

For instance, one unit increase in Rise onset alignment yields a change in the log odds of selecting "L\*+H" by 33, and one unit increase in Peak alignment yields a change in the log odds of selecting "L\*+H" by 68. But these beta values seem weird because the probability of these log odds are already 1.**
    
    **But setting aside the beta values, they compares two regression models and classifications, showing that the TCoG model explains the variance and shows more accuracy than the AM model.**

# 7. Conclusion
- The TCoG model is capable of outperforming standard AM models of tonal implementation in classifying pitch accents.

- Unlike the AM model, the TCoG model does not require the precise location of any particular points within the f0 contour. Thus, the TCoG model remains relatively stable under conditions of variability. 

- To conclude, the TCoG model is capable of capturing a range of perceptual effects involving global contour shape that remains puzzle in a unified way.

### Explanation of analysis
#### What did they do?
- **Exp1**: Compared the ability of the TCoG model with the AM model to correctly classify utterances of American English pitch accents, L+H\* and L\*+H.

- **Exp2**: Demonstrated the robustness
of the TCoG measure when there are missing values in f0, such as pitch movement onsets and offsets.

#### How did they do it?
- **Exp1**: Conducted binary logistic regression models for the TCoG and the AM models, respectively, and provided classification tables of correct percentage to show that the TCoG works better.

- **Exp2**: Conducted a number of logistic regression models and provided a graph of mean percent correct classification of L+H\* vs. L\*+H for the TCoG and AM models.
---
# 8. Evaluation
### Explanation of analysis
#### Why did they do it?
- Dependent variable, *pitch accent category*, is a categorical variable, which are either 
L+H\* and L\*+H pitch accents, while independent variables (TCoG, Rise onset, and peak alignments) are continuous.

- The percent correct classification was to show the accuracy of the regression models for the two models, respectively. 
---
# 8. Evaluation
### Appropriateness/novelty of analysis
- For the pitch accent categorization, it was appropriate to use binary regression analysis, since the dependent variable, *pitch accent category*, is categorical. 

- However, it is difficult to understand how they interpreted the binary logistic regressions. Logistic regression uses the log odds for the observed event, but the beta values in this study are so great (e.g., 136, 33, 68) such that the probability of these log odds are always 1 (100%). I wonder whether there are other ways they are interpreting, but other than that, it is difficult to understand since there is no detailed explanation about this.  

- For the classification analysis, this is my first time to see this analysis. But the logic and the way they are doing appear to be appropriate, since they wanted to see how the two theories would work by showing their predictions based on what they observed and comparing the accuracy of the models.

---
# 8. Evaluation
### Presentation of results

- I am not sure about their explanation of the results is correct due to the beta values in the summary of the regression analysis. Other than that, however, other explanations appear to be correct when they show the R-squared and the mean percent correct. It would have been great if they provided more specific interpretations about the statistical analysis.

- They used tables to interpret the results, but there was only one graph to visualize the results. It would have been better if they showed more visualization for the comparison of the theories. 
---
# 8. Evaluation
### Overall evaluation

- I liked the way they were trying to test their hypothesis using logistic regression models and using the classification table for the comparison of both theories.

- Also, they used R-squared values and correct percentage for the model comparison.

- However, they did not provide detailed explanation about the interpretation of the statistical analysis, such that it was so confusing to understand the results. Overall, they omitted a lot of explanation for the results and statistical analyses.

- There was only one graph that visualizes the correct percentage of classification. But it would have been better if they provided more graphs to show different performance of the models.
